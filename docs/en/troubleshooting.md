> **Check these four things first:** The currently selected project, the actual endpoint, the calling identity, and the SDK environment used to run the command.

## A 60-second diagnostic sequence

1. Classify where the error occurred: **local installation / management plane / model call / agent / tool / evaluation / logs**.
2. Record the time, status/error code, and request/response ID. Do not record tokens or API keys.
3. Reproduce it with the smallest possible request. Do not recreate every feature at once.

## Troubleshooting by symptom

| Symptom | Check first | Next action | Do not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | CLI login, tenant, and token audience | Sign in to the correct tenant and use authentication appropriate to the service | Paste tokens into chat or screenshots |
| 403 | Data-plane roles, agent/project identity, and network | Check the relevant scope and private network path separately | Give everyone subscription Owner |
| 404 | Project endpoint, model deployment name, and agent version | Copy the values again from the portal | Assume the model ID and deployment name are the same |
| 429 | RPM/TPM, judge quota, and concurrency | Reduce input/concurrency, honor Retry-After, and use bounded retries | Invoke repeatedly in an infinite loop |
| Deployment fails despite available quota | Capacity, deployment type, region, and access restrictions | Consider another approved deployment combination | Ignore country/region policies |
| Connection timeout | DNS, proxy, private endpoint, and firewall | Check from an environment inside the approved VNet | Enable public access just to pass |
| `PublicNetworkAccessDisabled` | Whether execution is taking place on an approved path | Use a supported path such as a VPN or development VM | Disable resource security |
| `ImportError` / missing module | Python path, venv, and requirements | Install/run using that venv's Python | Indiscriminately reinstall with global pip |
| Dependency conflict | Mixed core/advanced environments | Separate the two requirements sets and venvs | Force an upgrade of just one package to the latest version |
| `.env` error | Names, format, and placeholders | Enter only the two supported settings | Add an API key |
| Agent claims tool success without a call | Actual tool calls and traces | Inspect the prompt and tool registration | Trust the natural-language answer alone |
| Function tool stalls | Whether the client execution loop exists | Use the SDK runner or move to Hosted | Expect the portal to execute a local function |
| No file search results | Ingest status, store ID, and file contents | Check the file → store → agent connection order | Treat upload completion as indexing completion |
| Correct answer without citations | Actual annotations and original text | Preserve/display citations in the UI | Treat a filename string as evidence |
| IQ permission leak | ACL metadata, user token, and server validation | Trace permissions from the source through query time | Control access only through prompts |
| MCP does not continue after approval | Approval request ID and the same conversation | Return the correct approval response | Automatically approve every request |
| Toolbox 403 | Developer identity, agent identity, and user delegation | Give the actual calling principal minimum permissions | Assume creator permissions are inherited automatically |
| Evaluation is `Partial` | Required evaluator fields, judge quota, and tool runtime | Identify and rerun the failed evaluator | Average only the completed subset |
| `null` error at the gate | Missing human review | Review the actual response and evidence, then record a boolean | Fill every value with `true` |
| No trace | App Insights connection, permissions, time range, and ingestion delay | Create a new request and search by its ID | Treat an empty screen as proof that execution had no problems |
| Memory is not visible | Scope, new conversation, and update delay | Inspect the item/retrieval directly | Judge memory solely from output formatting |
| No response after publishing to Teams | Active version, Bot route, and tool execution location | Test publishing and actual invocation separately | Treat an app listing as final success |
| Costs keep increasing | Routines, voice, continuous evaluation, Search/PTU/runtime | Separate active, idle, and fixed costs | Only close the browser |
| Cleanup fails | Receipt endpoint, permissions, and ownership | Record the remaining IDs and retry | Delete the entire resource group |

## Safe information to include in a support request

```text
Module:
Execution method: portal / SDK / hosted / design
SDK environment: core or advanced
Error time and time zone:
Status / error code:
Response or request ID:

Redact internal endpoints and tenant/subscription IDs as appropriate for the audience as well. Do not attach secrets, tokens, or real user data.

## When the screen differs from the documentation

First check the new/Classic portal, Preview access, tenant rollout, region, and RBAC. If button names differ, consult official sources based on **the resource and action you intend to create or perform**. To avoid presenting an old screen as current, this guide focuses on tasks, fields, and completion criteria rather than fixed screenshots.
